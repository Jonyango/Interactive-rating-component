## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One of the my major learnings in this project was how to interact and manipualte the DOM. One of the things that stood out for me was why event delegation is important and how you can achieve it in your project.



```js
    img.parentNode.insertBefore(textDiv, img.nextSibling); // Proud of this as a way to insert an element after another element

```

### Continued development

I want continue learning about the DOM as well as mobile responsiveness.
